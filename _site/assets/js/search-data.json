This course dives into the principles and cutting-edge tools that make these capabilities possible. Students will explore three key paradigms in Natural Language Processing (NLP): supervised learning, the pretrain-then-finetune approach, and the latest advances in large language models, with a particular emphasis on representation learning techniques. The course combines theoretical foundations with practical applications. Students are expected to engage with research papers and gain hands-on experience through coding assignments and course projects. ",

You have 8 late days in total that can be distributed among the assignments. You may use a maximum of 7 late days for each assignment, i.e. we will not accept submissions a week after the deadline. Once you have used all 8 late days, each additional late day will incur a 5% penalty on the assignment, e.g., if you are late for two days (beyond the legitimate 8 late days) and get 80 points on the assignment, you final points will be 80-80*(5% + 5%)=72. | Collaboration policy: You may discuss problems with your classmates. However, you must write up the homework solutions and the code from scratch, without referring to notes from your joint session. In the submission, you must write down the names of any person with whom you discussed the problem; this will not affect your grade. | Submission: Assignments are submitted through Gradescope. At the beginning of the semester, you will be added to the Gradescope roster through Brightspace. Please do not register on Gradescope separately or change your email; this will cause the rosters will be out-of-sync. | Grading: We aim to release grades within two weeks of the submission date.

It allows you to apply what you have learned to a real problem. You are asked to complete the project in a group of 1 to 5 students. We strongly recommend you do projects in a team.
